This part of the plugin handles taxes for B2B i.e. Business to Business. Let's have a look at the options for B2B tax handling offered by the plugin and how it affects tax calculation for the end user.

- **B2B Sales** - When enabled (i.e. either EU Store or Non-EU Store), this option adds an option in the checkout form for making the purchase as a Business Entity. On clicking the B2B option in the checkout form, an additional Tax ID field is made visible for entering the Business Tax ID.

- **Tax ID field required for B2B** - Enabling this option makes it mandatory for all B2B transactions to provide a Business Tax ID.

- **B2B sales in the home country** - Whether B2B transactions getting done in the home country gets taxed or not is decided via this option.

- **B2B sales in the EU when VIES/VAT ID is provided** - If you would like to revoke taxes for B2B sales in the European Union if the Business Tax ID is provided, then this option should be enabled.

- **B2B sales outside the country** - For B2B sales apart from the home country, we can enable/disable taxes with the help of this option.
