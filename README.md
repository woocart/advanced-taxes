This plugin helps with configuring complex tax variations when selling in or into the EU.

The plugin is fully compliant with EU tax laws, with support for B2C and B2B sales, and Digital Goods tax. The defaults are configured for the most common configuration for EU companies. There are additional reports available for easier tax reporting.

Configuration instructions in the [readme file](https://github.com/woocart/tax-handling/blob/master/docs/README.md). Also available on [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/eu-vat-b2b-taxes/).
